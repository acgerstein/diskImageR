#Run the ImageJ analysis component, save the output. "newProject" shhould be changed to something of your choice (and then the same name used throughout); note that the quotation marks are required.
#To use a pop-up box interface:
IJMacro("newProject")

#To specify the appropriate directories without a popup:
IJMacro("newProject",  "/path/to/projectDir", "/path/to/projectDir/photographs/")

#Plot the result of ImageJ analysis (averaged among 72 lines draft outward from the center of the diffusion disk). Type ?plotRaw for additional parameter options.

#Use maximum likelihood to fit a bilogistic and single logistic model to the data from each photograph. "clearHalo" is used to specify a picture that has a clear halo; this is used to standardize all photographs and will be most effective when photographs are taken with equal lighting without shadows. 
maxLik("newProject", clearHalo=1, RAD="all", typical = FALSE)

#Use the models to calculate resistance (20%, 50% and 80% reduction in growth = RAD20, RAD50, RAD80), tolerance (actual fraction of growth achvied above RAD relative to potential growth = FoG20, FoG50, FoG80), and sensitivity (slope at RAD50), which are saved in a .csv file.

#[OPTIONAL] Calculate corresponding MIC values from RAD values using either built-in data for specific species/drug combinations or supply your own RAD/MIC data to use for a standard curve
