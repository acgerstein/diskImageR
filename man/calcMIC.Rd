\title{Convert RAD to MIC based on built-in or provided parameters or datasets}
\usage{
calcMIC(
  projectName,
  type = "df",
  RAD = "20",
  height = 4,
  width = 6,
  addBreakpoints = TRUE,
  savePDF = TRUE,
  popUp = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{projectName}{the short name you have been using for the project.}

\item{type}{specify whether the dataset to use is a dataframe with all data ("df") or an aggregated dataframe ("ag")}

\item{RAD}{a numeric value the the critical level of the radius of inhibition (i.e., resistance) parameter to use for MIC. Currently only \code{RAD} = "80" (80\% reduction in growth), \code{RAD} = "50" (50\% reduction in growth), and \code{RAD} = "20" (20\% reduction in growth) are supported [Default = "20"]}

\item{height}{a numeric value indicating the height of the pdf file generated}

\item{width}{a numeric value indicating the width of the pdf file generated}

\item{addBreakpoints}{Indicates whether to add breakpoint lines to the standard curve plot (if the user has supplied data to generate a standard curve)}

\item{savePDF}{a logical value indicating whether to save a PDF file or open a new quartz window. Defaults to TRUE (saves a pdf file).}

\item{popUp}{a logical value indicating whether to pop up the figure after it has been created}
}
\value{
In all cases the function will return an updated .csv file that contains the MIC values that correspond to calculated RAD values in the directory "parameter_files" in the main project directory. If the user has supplied their own MIC data the function will also save the calculated model parameters into a separate file and will plot the linear relationship and line of best fit.
}
\description{
Used to convert RAD into MIC. In all cases the linear relationship is log2(MIC) regressed onto RAD^2. This conversion can be based on a) existing built-in data from a number of species/drug combinations, b) a user-supplied slope and intercept of log2(MIC) regressed on RAD^2 for the species/drug combination of interest, c) a user supplied file containing MIC information from lines previously analyzed by diskImageR for RAD, or d) a user supplied file containing both RAD and MIC information. Note that user-supplied data should be MIC and RAD, not log2(MIC) and RAD^2 (the function will do this authomatically).
